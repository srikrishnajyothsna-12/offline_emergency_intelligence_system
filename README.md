# offline_emergency_intelligence_system
An offline-first mobile application that provides emergency instructions and shelter information during disasters using Flutter and Firebase.  
🚨 Offline-First Emergency Intelligence System

An offline-capable mobile application designed to help people navigate safely and access emergency guidance during disasters such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes, even when internet connectivity is unavailable.

📌 Problem Statement

During natural disasters, internet and mobile networks often fail. As a result, people:

Cannot access maps or navigation

Do not know safe evacuation routes

Are unaware of nearby shelters or hospitals

Struggle to understand long emergency advisories, especially in local languages

This leads to panic, delayed evacuation, and increased risk to human life.

💡 Solution Overview

The Offline-First Emergency Intelligence System addresses this problem by providing:

Offline navigation using last-synced maps

Safe route prediction based on crowd updates

AI-powered emergency instruction summarization

Local language support for better accessibility

🔑 Key Features

📍 Offline Maps using last-synced Google Maps data

🛣️ Safe Route Suggestions avoiding blocked or flooded roads

🏥 Offline Access to Shelters & Hospitals

🤖 Gemini AI Summarization of emergency instructions

🌐 Local Language Support

🔄 Firebase Sync when internet becomes available
