# offline_emergency_intelligence_system
An offline-first mobile application that provides emergency instructions and shelter information during disasters using Flutter and Firebase.  
Offline Emergency Intelligence System 🚨
📌 Overview
The Offline Emergency Intelligence System is a mobile application designed to provide critical emergency information during natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes—especially when internet connectivity is unavailable.

The application follows an offline-first approach, ensuring that essential emergency instructions and shelter information remain accessible even during complete network outages.

❓ Problem Statement
During disaster situations, internet connectivity often fails, leaving people without access to life-saving emergency instructions, shelter information, and guidance when it is most needed.

💡 Solution
This project provides an Offline Emergency Intelligence mobile application that enables users to:

Access emergency instructions without internet
View shelter information stored locally on the device
Submit basic crowd reports that synchronize when connectivity is restored
The solution prioritizes reliability, accessibility, and simplicity during crisis situations.
